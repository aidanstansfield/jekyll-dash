# Deprecated

Note, this repo is no longer in use, since GitHub pages only supports a few plugins by default. I have now opted to build the site (with as many plugins as I want) locally, and then push the built product to the master branch of my blog. See [my blog repo](https://github.com/aidanstansfield/aidanstansfield.github.io) for more details
